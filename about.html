                    <h3>MUSIC:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before the Grace Hopper Program, I worked as a
                        professional violist and violin/viola teacher. I loved
                        to find the intersections between modern tools and
                        classical instruments, whether through creative video
                        editing during performance, arranging modern songs and
                        soundtracks for my students, or bringing in a house band
                        to perform on my student recitals. My new creative
                        outlet is coding, and that’s where now I apply my
                        instrumental skillset of deliberate practice, pattern
                        recognition, and methodical debugging by changing just
                        one thing at a time.

                        <h3>D&D:</h3>
                        <p>
                            I like to combine my skills as a teacher, performer,
                            and project manager into crafting immersive Dungeons
                            & Dragons experiences for diverse groups of players.
                            I've DM'd for a traditional high fantasy group at my
                            CrossFit gym (levels 1-13!), a group of newbie
                            friends in a low-combat/high-creativity home game,
                            an online-only crew, and various one-shots. In my
                            previous work I engaged students with lesson plans
                            chock full of opportunities for belonging and
                            collaboration; now I get to bring my storytelling
                            abilities, sense of humor, and understanding of
                            diverse needs to the table. I love tailoring
                            adventures to each group's unique interests,
                            backgrounds, identities, and even attention spans.

                            Studios 48-Hour Film Project Team. Each year we get
                            together in the summer to write, produce, and edit a
                            short film in the span of 48 hours. Here I am in the
                            editing bay, taking a break from editing away in
                            Premiere Pro. Since our inception in 2018, I've
                            participated in writing, editing, directing, acting,
                            props, set design, and even craft services. Check
