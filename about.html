                              <p>
                                   I like to combine my skills as a teacher,
                                   performer, and project manager into crafting
                                   immersive Dungeons & Dragons experiences for
                                   diverse groups of players. I've DM'd for a
                                   traditional high fantasy group at my CrossFit
                                   gym (levels 1-13!), a group of newbie friends
                                   in a low-combat/high-creativity home game, an
                                   online-only crew, and various one-shots. In
                                   my previous work I engaged students with
                                   lesson plans chock full of opportunities for
                                   belonging and collaboration; now I get to
                                   bring my storytelling abilities, sense of
                                   humor, and understanding of diverse needs to
                                   the table. I love tailoring adventures to
                                   each group's unique interests, backgrounds,
                                   identities, and even attention spans.

                                   I also enjoy playing various roles in the
                                   Jabroni Studios 48-Hour Film Project Team.
                                   Each year we get together in the summer to
                                   write, produce, and edit a short film in the
                                   span of 48 hours. Here I am in the editing
                                   bay, taking a break from editing away in
                                   Premiere Pro. Since our inception in 2018,
                                   I've participated in writing, editing,
                                   directing, acting, props, set design, and
                                   even craft services. Check out our work at
                                   Jabroni Studios NHV on YouTube.
