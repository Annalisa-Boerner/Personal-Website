# Welcome to my site!

The first assessment at my bootcamp (the Grace Hopper Program) was a personal website built in HTML5 and CSS. 

It's been through various revisions since then, including some very helpful user testing. It's amazing what people click on! (Thanks, Sam.) Please poke around and learn a little more about me and my work.

This is also my first mobile-responsive project.
